				<p>For our first time in Japan, we chose to go to Osaka and arrived at the Kansai International Airport (KIX). From there, we took the fastest option into the heart of the city, Namba, thru the Rapi:t train, which has a very cool retro-futuristic design. Osaka has a simpler train lines' network than Tokyo, and it is said to be a more tourist-friendly city and in our experience, we found that to be true. Although, it does not mean we did not enjoy being in Tokyo, too, so wait for our next blog post on that. ðŸ˜Š</p>

				<p>Going to Universal Studios Japan was the plan for the next day so off we went to bed in our Airbnb. We found a great one that's so near to the Osaka Loop Line so that meant we only had to go in one ride from Namba to Nishikujo. And that's very convenient when you arrive at night like we did. The following morning, we only had to take again just one short ride from Nishikujo to Universal Studios Japan.</p>

					<p>The first order of business for any self-respecting Potterhead, of course, is to visit Hogwarts. But before you reach the castle, you'd first enter Hogsmeade village where a bunch of shops and the Hogwarts Express come to life for you. So if you're the type who goes crazy shopping-eyed at once, best not to panic just yet as there's another hidden store beneath the castle. There's the mandatory Hogwarts Castle walk, where you can see the Portrait Ghosts, and two rides as far as I can remember. We tried the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey<sup>TM</sup>. World's number one ride for many years and for good reason, where else can you chase the Golden Snitch in a Quidditch game with dragons and dementors thrown in the mix? Outside the castle, there's the second ride called Flight of the Hippogriff but it was too chilly in winter to consider "flying" so we took a pass on that.</p>

				<p>It was mid-winter 2017 and we were just in time for Universal Cool Japan 2017 with attractions such as Attack on Titan, Monster Hunter and Detective Conan. So, forgive us if we cannot comment on the usual attractions as we were so preoccupied with the geeky stuff. The escape game encompassing four floors of detection and problem-solving where you walk with an iPad and Conan chats with you to give instructions is this girl's dream come true.</p>

				<p>On the next day, we booked a complete package tour with roundtrip service, tickets and meals to Biwako Valley Ski Resort thru Japanican website. However, we must have been so exhausted from running down the amusement park the day before and we woke up a bit later than we should have. There's no negotiating 'time' with the Japanese, we knew this already, and yet there's no giving up with us also, so I called up the tour hotline while we're hurrying thru the maze of subway shops to the departure area and asked what we can do. I was offered 50% refund, as consolation since I called to inform anyway, but the kind operator said we should still try and catch the bus. When we got there, the bus had indeed departed but the facilitators tried to help us anyway. They told us we might still catch the bus at its 2nd stop to pick up the rest of the tourists before it finally goes off into the highway. So, we took a taxi and guess what? We made it. And it's all because of time-perfect people who held off on judging non-time-perfect people and instead chose to help them anyway. Imma cry. ðŸ˜­</p>

				<p>The last few days we just spent utilizing our Osaka Amazing Pass and Kyoto Keihan Pass. Osaka Castle is practically an icon and must not be missed. In Kyoto, we prioritized visiting the Kinkakuji (Golden Temple) because it really is one-of-a-kind. Even on a gloomy winter morning, it shines. No filter needed. Then, we bought goods from Uji, the land of matcha. Byodoin Temple is also nearby so we hit that too. If watching Koi glide thru serene waters in a lush landscape is for you, there's no better place. It was almost nightfall but we really wanted to walk thru rows of red torii gates so we pursued Fushimi Inari shrine. The place was so quiet albeit steps every now and then from night-time venturers like us. It was pretty and almost creepy. Then finally, we navigated ourselves to Arashiyama to see the famous bamboo grove. Unfortunately, we learned that they do not allow entrance to the forest on rainy nights. Other nights they do, just not our luck (with the weather). Thankfully, we got treated to a different kind of forest. The Kimono Forest in Randen Arashiyama station is a collection of gorgeous kimono wrapped up in clear cylinder and lighted at night. Very pretty.</p>
